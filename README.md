# GL engine

My repository for some experiments with OpenGL.

# How to build :

At the moment, the libraries required for building this are :
-SFML 2.3
-GLEW
-OpenGL (obviously)
-Boost (specifically Boost.Test)

To build a project with CMake, copy either test_main.cpp or real_main.cpp (src dir) into src/main.cpp, then launch CMake.
Alternatively, with Unix, use the shells scripts provided.
